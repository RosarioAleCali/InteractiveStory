Interactive Story

Interactive Story is an App I developed following an introductory course on Team Treehouse about Android App Development. 
As an introductory course the app itself is very simple but it teaches concepts and techniques about developing an Android App 
that are a lot used in Apps that follow Google's guidelines.

A few things that I have learnt are:

* Displaying images in an ImageView.
* Getting input from an EditText.
* Starting Activities with Intents.
* Passing data between Activities.
* Using the MVP design pattern.
